## üìù Creating a Hunt via UI

You can create new hunts by going to `hunt/create` and filling out the form.

### Steps

<img width="1280" height="720" alt="Khoj Create Hunt Guide" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ff6198e-0308-4231-b1ff-98bb79834124" />

1. Choose the right network (currently supports Base and Polkadot Moonbeam)
2. Enter the hunt details like - name, description, start/end time, theme, etc.
3. Check the "Teams Enabled" checkbox if you want to enable Teams
3.1 If teams are enabled, enter the max team size
4. Add a clue by adding a description of an answer, and the coordinates of the clue
5. Once all clues are added, add an NFT Image for the hunt
6. Click on the "Create Hunt" button

You have successfully created a hunt.




## üìù Creating a Hunt via Remix

You can create a new hunt directly on-chain using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and the `Khoj.sol` smart contract. This is useful for admins or sponsors who want to launch a new treasure hunt with custom parameters.

### Step 1: Deploy the Khoj Contract (if not already deployed)
1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Upload the `Khoj.sol` and `KhojNFT.sol` files from the `contracts/` directory of this repo.
3. Compile both contracts using the Solidity compiler in Remix.
4. Deploy the `KhojNFT` contract first. Copy its deployed address.
5. Deploy the `Khoj` contract, passing the `KhojNFT` contract address as the constructor argument.

> **Note:** If the contract is already deployed on your target network, you can skip deployment and just interact with the existing contract address.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Hunt Data
Here is an example hunt you can create:

- **_name:** `Goa Hack`
- **_description:** `This is a a hackathon hunt`
- **startsAt:** `20240607` (Format: YYYYMMDD)
- **_clues_blobId:** `KWgH3bJHO0_ZfBnxjp2XR3U0nqGeq4XivhYk9JI5e6s`
- **_answers_blobId:** `0x7C31d6A0B7b10eE9e79f601265691EA6F28E86BC`
- **_duration:** `6000` (in seconds)

### Step 3: Call `createHunt` in Remix
1. In Remix, select the deployed `Khoj` contract instance.
2. Find the `createHunt` function in the contract's interface.
3. Enter the parameters as follows:
   - `_name`: `Goa Hack`
   - `_description`: `This is a a hackathon hunt`
   - `startsAt`: `20240607`
   - `_clues_blobId`: `KWgH3bJHO0_ZfBnxjp2XR3U0nqGeq4XivhYk9JI5e6s`
   - `_answers_blobId`: `0x7C31d6A0B7b10eE9e79f601265691EA6F28E86BC`
   - `_duration`: `6000`
4. Click `transact` to create the hunt. The transaction will return a new `huntId`.

### Step 4: Verify the Hunt
- Use the `getAllHunts` or `getHunt(huntId)` function to verify your hunt was created successfully.
- Your hunt will now be available for users to register and participate in via the Khoj platform!

> **Tip:** Make sure you are connected to the correct network (Base, Moonbeam, or BNB Chain) in Remix before deploying or interacting with the contract.
